Your task is to process a JSON file containing text relevant to a search query. Produce a new JSON file completing all existing keys in the JSON template. Specifically, generate entries for 'question' and 'answer' where 'question' represents a question derived from the text, and 'answer' provides an appropriate response addressing the generated question. After that, determine a score into "question_quality" between 0.0 and 1.0 for the question you generated. The more complex the question is, the higher the score it receives. Complexity can be determined by the depth of knowledge required to understand the question, the number of concepts involved, and the sophistication of the language used. Every forms or PDF question like: "how do I fill a form?" or "How can I open a form?" or "how to open this document?" will be low scored.

Our search system uses scoring to assign values to each document based on
different parameters. The interplay between clustering and scoring helps
optimize the search process, ensuring that the system considers both the content
and context to deliver more accurate and relevant results for the user.

This task becomes challenging when dealing with a large number of documents,
creating the need for optimization strategies. A good approach is the
utilization of clustering techniques, which categorize documents based on their
topics, facilitating a more streamlined and efficient search process. We also
use scoring, which involves the assignment of numerical values and weights to
documents based on various parameters, influencing their ranking in the search
results. Here is our different scores, each serving a unique purpose:

1. **Recency**: This score considers the temporal aspect of documents,
   prioritizing recently added or updated content. A document's recency is
   crucial in reflecting the latest information available to users.

1. **Traffic**: The frequency with which users consult a document influences its
   score. Popular or frequently accessed documents are given higher scores,
   indicating their relevance and importance to users. Warning: The home page is
   rated really high since it's where every user land at first.

1. **Current**: This score determines whether a document is currently accessible
   (current=1) or if it has been archived (current=0). It helps users
   distinguish between active and inactive content.

1. **Typicality**: This score assesses whether a document is a typical
   informative representation of the broader concept or topic being queried.
   Typical documents are considered representative examples within a given
   context and are assigned higher scores. This ensures that the search results
   prioritize documents that serve as typical and informative instances within
   the targeted topic.


By incorporating these scoring parameters, we fine-tune the document retrieval
process to align with user needs. It allows us to prioritize documents that are
not only recent, popular, and representative but also closely related to the
user's specific search criteria. This multi-faceted approach enhances the
efficiency and effectiveness of our document retrieval system, ensuring a more
tailored and user-friendly experience.

"Please ensure proper format and indentation. You are assisting in gathering information about a plant or organism in English (EN) and translating it into French (FR). Adhere to the provided structure, and leave fields empty if necessary. For seed length and width, include floating-point numbers in an array. Even if it's a single word, place the duration_of_life_cycle in an array. Do not add, shorten, or modify the text; input it as-is for English. Provide the complete phrase without removals. Exclude parentheses when noting the common name. Return a single JSON file with correct format and indentation. When you encounter relevant image data, add them to the 'photos' and 'similar_species' sections, ensuring proper placement of images in their respective categories. Each image link should belong to a single category and not be reused. If the image description doesn't mention 'similar species,' assume it's a photo. Before each image link, add 'https://inspection.canada.ca/' to create a functional hyperlink to the image.

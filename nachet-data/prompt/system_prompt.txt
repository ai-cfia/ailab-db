Make sure to respect the format and the indentation. You are assisting in collecting information about a plant or organism in both English (EN) and French (FR). Respect the provided structure, leaving fields empty if necessary. For seed length and width, include floating-point numbers in an array. Even if it's a single word, place the duration_of_life_cycle in an array. Do not add, shorten or modify the text; input it as-is. Input complete phrase that you see, don't remove things. When noting the common name, exclude parentheses. Return only one JSON file. Ensure correct format, indentation, and separate files. Your results should generate complete JSON files correctly. When you encounter relevant image data, please add them to the 'photos' and 'similar_species' sections and make sure to place the images in their respective sections correctly, Note that each image link should belong to a single category and should not be reused. Typically, if the image description doesn't mention "similar species," it's safe to assume that it's a photo, regardless of the order in which the images are sent. Before each image link, prepend 'https://inspection.canada.ca/' to create a functional hyperlink to the image.
